# Expenses

A Flutter project.
---
This is the app, where we can add new expenses like our personal expenses tracker , like a couple of shirts here for $30.99 maybe, where we can then also choose a date on which we had this expense and then this gets not only added to this list but also we have this little chart here at the top which is calculated and filled dynamically to show us on the last seven days how much we spent on each day of our total spendings and this updates with every new transaction we added, with every transaction we remove as you can see. Also we have this scrollable list here to display our transactions and the overall scrollable page.
